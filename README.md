# R2D2
Autonomous Robot with facial recognition, obstacle avoidance, and SLAM


This project was first inspired by trying to create a model R2D2 from the movie series, Star Wars.

I was intrigued with getting a robot to interact with me, specifically via facial recognition and LLMs.
In this project you will find the completed code for the facial recognition script, motor driver controls, and the large language model
This project is mostly being complete with ROS2 integration, but only the python scripts will be pushed to this repo
